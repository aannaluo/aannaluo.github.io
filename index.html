                        <p>This personal website is a project that I have developed using HTML, CSS and JS.
                            I am continually updating and improving this site as I learn more about web development and
                            advance my career.</p>

                        <h3>SAP Workplace</h3>
                        <p>This project was developed and designed during the first ever SAP-hosted hackathon. The goal of this application
                            is to make it easier for SAP employees to access amenity space. We developed
                            this using the MERN Stack, building the front-end with HTML, CSS, React, and Boostrap.js, and the back-end
                            with Node.js, connecting it to a database hosted on MongoDB. API testing for the backend was executed using Postman.</p>

                        <h3>BeSmart</h3>
                        <p>This application was built to help students study with the active recall method, where notifications
                        are sent on random throughout the day for students to complete a question from a particular subject. We
                        build a design prototype of this app using Figma, and built the back-end using Python.</p>

                        <h3>Stockup</h3>
                        <p>Stockup is an app I developed using Java and the Java Swing Library. I made this app with the intent to reduce food waste
                            in a household by allowing users keep track of what they buy and see what is most commonly consumed or wasted.</p>

                        <h3>Networking App</h3>
                        <p>The goal of this application is to allow students to easily record and keep track of professional
                            mentors they met at events, as well as all professionals they have met at a specific event. This is still
                            a work in progress as we are planning to execute the front-end using Javascript and the back-end using
                            Python with Flask. We have created databases to keep track of all necessary data on postgreSQL.</p>
